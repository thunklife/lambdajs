###Î».js

An on-going project to implement the lambda calculus in JavaScript. Because fun.

I'm working through [An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_3/188-6217779-4304701?ie=UTF8&refRID=0GJF37GTKVB9RNVA2RB2). As I do, I thought it might be fun to implement each function in JS, and then see what I can do with them.
